        The most important part of craft beer is how to properly consume it! By consuming I don't mean this is a guide to tell you how to actually drink your beer.
        <br>This is a guide to how to find the best possible product and ways to enjoy it.
    </p>
    <p>Purchasing package beer from a store can be a bit intimidating if there is a large selection, or you don't know what you like.
    <br>Purchasing beer that is out of date or poorly handled can leave a bad taste in your mouth.
    <br>Sometimes this is completely out of the breweries hand, and can keep you exploring beers from great breweries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are a few pointers for making sure you get the best quality package.

        </li>
        <li>
            Try to shop at a store that stores the beer cold at all times. Most craft beer is unfiltered and unpasteurized.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Another great way to enjoy craft beer is with food. With so many beer styles out available there are just as many foods you can pair with every one.
        <br>My favorite way to enjoy craft beer with food is meals cooked in my own kitchen. That being said not everyone enjoys cooking at home the way i do.
        <br>Luckily, the're are quite a few ways to get great food beer parings.

        The last way to be a good Craft Beer consumer is to be a positive part of the craft beer community. 
        <br>It's the most important and can help you really get the great feel of the craft beer community.
