        There are a few things to know before before you dive into understanding beer production.
        Before you dive into beer production there is something important to know.<br>Brewers don't make beer yeast does!
        We'll get back to that in a minute. There are two main parts to beer production.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first part of beer production is actually brewing. This is otherwise known as the hot side of production. During this process the brewers make a sugary liquid wort.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Malted barley and grains are steeped in hot water
        </li>
        <li>
            The grains are rinsed with hot water and the liquid separated into a boil kettle  
        </li>
        <li>
            The liquid called wort is boiled with hops, a bittering agent
        </li>
        <li>
            The bitter wort is cooled town and moved over to a fermenter
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The second stage begins as soon as the wort is chilled and moved to the fermenter. Anything done at this point on is known as the cold side of production.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Yeast is added to the chilled wort and now can be referred to as beer
        </li>
        <li>
            The yeast eats the sugars and converts it into alcohol 
        </li>
        <li>
            When the yeast is done fermenting the beer is chilled and the contents allowed to settle
        </li>
        <li>
            The beer is then separated from the settled contents carbonated and packaged
        </li>
    </ol>
